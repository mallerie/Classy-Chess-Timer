# Classy-Chess-Timer
This is a two player chess timer that keeps track of play time so that players can focus on their strategy. 

## Getting Started
The instructions below will give you a clear idea on how to read the code, play the game, and submit 
pull requests to make improvements of your own.

### How to Play:
Begin the game by pressing the 'start' button. Player One always goes first. When player one has completed their
move, they should press the 'switch' button in order to notify the program that they have completed their move and 
to stop their clock and start Player Two's clock. Play should continue in this fashion until the game is complete. 
The game is over when one player's timer gets to zero. The player with time still left wins.
